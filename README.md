# API-Python

This project consist of a REST API that reflects how a social app works. It simulates a post system, where users can share their message (title + content) and upvote the content they like.

The API has been developed using Python, FastAPI and a PostgreSQL Database. During the development IÂ´ve been using Postman and Pgadmin4 to test the different implementations while developing.
Finally, I developed tests for the code using Pytest, implemented Docker for the deployment and Github Actions to have a pipeline for CI/CD.
